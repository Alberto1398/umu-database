GOG:

Notes:
- ID value is the codename
- Only use those marked Type: Game

Epic Games:

Notes:
- ID value is the codename

Steam:
https://steamdb.info
Notes:
- We don't make ulwgl entries for steam games, but we do make protonfixes. As stated
in the rules, ulwgl IDs are referenced to steam IDs if both a steam and non-steam
version of the game exists, and the non-steam game versions are symlinked to 
the steam version protonfixes,so It's useful to check if a steam version exists.

TODO:
Add more sources for Humble, Amazon, EA, Battlenet, Ubisoft, itch.io
